# SparkGood — Project Brief

## The Problem

Millions of people want to make a difference in the world but don't know where to start. They have the desire but lack:
- **Knowledge** — How do I actually start a nonprofit? What makes a social enterprise viable?
- **Direction** — Which of my many interests should I focus on? What would actually work?
- **Resources** — I don't have money for consultants, accelerators, or business school
- **Confidence** — I've never done this before. Am I even qualified?

Meanwhile, AI business tools are exploding — but they all optimize for profit, not purpose. None of them ask "how does this make the world better?"

## The Solution

SparkGood is a dual-product platform:

### Product 1: The Web App
A free-to-start guided experience that takes anyone from "I want to do something good" to a concrete plan. Uses AI research tools (Perplexity, Firecrawl) behind the scenes to deliver real market data, not just LLM guesses. Paid users get complete launch packages: market research, business plans, marketing assets, and step-by-step action roadmaps.

### Product 2: The Pro Toolkit
A downloadable package of 13+ Claude Code skills for advanced users. Same frameworks that power the web app, but installed in the user's own Claude Code environment for full control and customization. Includes research skills, strategy skills, execution skills, marketing skills, and an orchestrator that guides users through the process.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. The Social Impact Filter
Every idea, every plan, every recommendation is viewed through the lens of "does this create real good in the world?" This isn't a feature — it's the foundation.

### 2. Community Projects (Not Just Businesses)
Most tools assume you want to make money. SparkGood includes a "community project" path for people who just want to organize a neighborhood cleanup, start a tutoring program, or launch a community garden. No revenue model needed. Just impact.

### 3. Real Research, Not Just AI Guesses
The web app runs Perplexity searches and Firecrawl scraping behind the scenes. When we tell you about your competitive landscape, we actually looked. When we size your market, we used real data. This is not ChatGPT hallucinating market stats.

### 4. Calibrated to the Individual
A retired teacher with zero budget and no business experience gets completely different output than a serial entrepreneur with $50K to invest. Everything adjusts to the user's actual situation.

### 5. End-to-End, Not Just Ideas
Competitors stop at idea generation. SparkGood takes you from idea → viability analysis → business plan → marketing assets → week-by-week launch roadmap.

### 6. Power User Option
Advanced users aren't locked into a web UI. The Pro Toolkit gives them the same frameworks in Claude Code where they can customize, extend, and integrate with their own workflows.
