    executiveSummary: `${idea.name} addresses a fundamental problem: households have resources sitting unused while neighbors struggle without access to these same items. Our solution creates a hyperlocal sharing network that reduces waste, saves money, and builds genuine community connections.

In Year 1, we will launch in 3 neighborhoods, facilitate 500+ successful shares, and build a community of 200 active members. Our approach starts analog (community boards, group chats) before investing in technology, ensuring we understand actual user needs.

The model is sustainable through a combination of volunteer coordination, small membership fees for premium features, and partnerships with local businesses and apartment complexes seeking community amenities.`,

I wanted to tell you about something we're building in the neighborhood.

You know how everyone owns a drill they use twice a year? A pressure washer that sits in the garage? A stand mixer that comes out once at Thanksgiving?

What if you could just borrow those things from neighbors — and lend out your own unused stuff in return?

That's ${idea.name}.

Here's how it works:
1. Join our community (takes 2 minutes)
2. List items you're willing to share
3. Browse what neighbors have available
4. Connect, borrow, return, repeat

No apps to download. No weird fees. Just neighbors helping neighbors.

We already have 50+ families sharing everything from power tools to party supplies. Last month alone, members saved over $2,000 they would have spent buying things they'll barely use.

But honestly? The best part isn't the savings. It's actually knowing your neighbors.
