- Many don't know how to get funded

### 4. Organizational Challenges (Why Social Enterprises Fail)

2. **Can't describe impact model** - know they're doing good but can't articulate it
3. **Haven't created something people will pay for**

## The Intention-Action Gap (SparkGood's Core Problem)

### The Evidence
- **70% of Americans** care deeply about social causes (environment, poverty, climate)
- **80% globally** want governments to take stronger climate action
- **86%** want countries to work together on climate
- **BUT: Few take concrete action**

### Why The Gap Exists
- Only **19% of first-time donors** return to give again
- Social trust only **modestly associated** with civic activities
- Americans **overestimate global median income by 10x**
- When corrected, willingness to donate increases **55%**

### The Opportunity
When people learn the actual scale of problems and see clear pathways to help:
- Donations to international charities increased **61%**
- Information + clear action paths = dramatically increased engagement

**This is SparkGood's core value proposition: Bridge intention to action.**
