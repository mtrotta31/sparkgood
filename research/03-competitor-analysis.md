## Key Competitive Insights

### Where Competitors Fail:
1. **Intention-action gap:** No one helps people who care but don't know where to start
2. **Social impact blindness:** Tools assume profit-first business model
3. **Community project neglect:** No tools for local, volunteer-driven projects
4. **Fragmented journey:** Users must stitch together 5+ tools to go from idea to launch
5. **Intimidation factor:** Most tools assume business experience

### Market Opportunity:

- Gen Z/Millennials specifically want purpose-driven ventures
- No single tool bridges "wanting to help" → "ready to launch"
- Nonprofit sector growing 20% YoY with tech-adoption gaps

### Competitor Weaknesses to Exploit:
1. StartSomeGood = too slow (courses, cohorts)
2. ValidatorAI = too generic (no impact focus)
3. PrometAI/LivePlan = assumes you already have an idea
4. Startup.ai = tech products only
5. All = no marketing assets or action roadmaps
