## Conversational UI Design Principles

### Core Philosophy
- Enable natural dialogues, not rigid forms
- Reduce cognitive load
- Feel like talking to a trusted guide
- Prioritize user goals and contexts
- Simplify complex tasks through conversation

### Three Essential Principles

**1. Clear Flow**
- Define the purpose (specialized, not everything at once)
- Anticipate user needs
- Minimize required input
- Feel like a wizard guiding users

**2. User Control**
- Users should feel in control, not controlled
- Provide undo and cancel at all times
- Allow conversation reset anytime
- Confirm critical inputs as questions
- Let users correct before proceeding

**3. Natural Personality**
- Conversation should sound natural
- Design vocabulary that resonates with target users
- Be concise — people don't speak in paragraphs
- Ask one question at a time
- Proceed only after getting needed information

---

## Multi-Step Flow Best Practices

### Cognitive Structure
- Group by **mental transitions**, not technical categories
- Ask: "How many cognitive shifts does the user make?"
- Keep steps feeling like natural progression

### Usability Principles
| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Clear navigation | "Next" and "Back" prominent and predictable |
| Disabled states | If "Next" is disabled, explain why |
| State awareness | Show "Step 3 of 6" in header |
| Progress indication | Progress bar or dots |
| Clickability | If steps are editable, make it obvious |
| Dynamic flow | If conditional, adapt step count |

### Mobile Considerations
- **≤3 steps:** Can show full stepper
- **>3 steps:** Show current step + light progress bar
- Consider vertical stacked approach for onboarding
- Use collapsible menu for full step list

### Accessibility Requirements
- ARIA labels for current step
- Don't rely on color alone (add shape/label)
- Allow keyboard navigation
- Screen readers should announce step name and state

## Onboarding Flow Excellence

### Key Principles
1. **Define success for each user type** — what is their "first win"?
2. **Simplest path to that win** — remove all friction
3. **Personalized onboarding** — different users, different flows
4. **Progressive disclosure** — info only when needed
5. **Emotional engagement** — micro-rewards, progress bars, animations

### Psychological Techniques
- **Dopamine hits:** Small rewards keep users engaged
- **Progress visualization:** Show how far they've come
- **Celebration moments:** Acknowledge completion of steps
- **Commitment devices:** Get small yeses before big asks

- Ask for additional info AFTER primary action completes

### Build Trust
- Impact metrics, success stories, testimonials
- Secure payment badges near forms
- Transparent about where money/effort goes

### Design Principles
- Use white space and clean design
- Keep focus on mission, not on interface
- User test forms, buttons, navigation regularly
- Every touchpoint guides toward goal
