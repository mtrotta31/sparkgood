Women-owned businesses are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. economy. According to recent data, women now own more than 14 million businesses in the United States, generating trillions in revenue and employing millions of workers. Yet despite this growth, women entrepreneurs still face a significant funding gap — receiving a fraction of the venture capital and business loans that go to their male counterparts.

That's where grants come in.

Unlike loans, grants don't need to be repaid. Unlike venture capital, you don't give up equity or control of your business. Grant funding is essentially free money to grow your business — if you know where to find it and how to apply.

This guide covers the best small business grants for women in 2026, from federal programs to corporate foundations, plus practical tips to strengthen your applications.

## Federal Grants and SBA Programs

Let's start with the most common misconception: the Small Business Administration (SBA) doesn't directly award grants to most small businesses. Instead, the SBA primarily offers loan programs backed by the federal government, making it easier for small businesses to qualify for bank financing.

However, the SBA does fund programs that provide free resources, training, and connections to grant opportunities:

**Women's Business Centers (WBCs):** The SBA funds over 140 Women's Business Centers across the country. These centers offer free or low-cost business training, counseling, and mentorship specifically for women entrepreneurs. Many WBCs also help connect women to grant opportunities in their region and provide guidance on applications.

**SCORE Mentorship:** While not women-specific, SCORE provides free mentoring from experienced business professionals. Many SCORE chapters have mentors who specialize in helping women-owned businesses access funding.

**SBIR and STTR Programs:** If you're a woman in STEM, pay close attention. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs award billions in federal grants each year to small businesses developing innovative technologies. These are competitive, but they're real grants — not loans — and agencies actively encourage applications from women-owned businesses.

To find Women's Business Centers and SBA resources near you, browse the [SBA resource directory](/resources/sba). Many cities have multiple programs available.

## Corporate Grant Programs

Some of the most accessible grants for women entrepreneurs come from corporations and private foundations. These programs typically have straightforward applications and award grants on a regular cycle.

**Amber Grant:** One of the longest-running grants for women, the Amber Grant awards funding to women-owned businesses every month, with additional annual awards for top recipients. The grant is named after Amber Wigdahl, who died at age 19 before she could realize her entrepreneurial dreams. Her parents created the grant in her memory. Check the current grant amount and application deadlines at ambergrantsforwomen.com.

**IFundWomen:** This platform combines crowdfunding with grant opportunities. IFundWomen partners with corporations and foundations to offer grants specifically for women-owned businesses, including grants for women of color, women in specific industries, and women in certain geographic areas. New grant opportunities are posted regularly.

**Cartier Women's Initiative:** An international program supporting women impact entrepreneurs. The Cartier Women's Initiative provides grant funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities to women running businesses that create strong social impact. This is a prestigious, competitive program — but the rewards extend far beyond the cash prize.

**Hello Alice Grants:** Hello Alice partners with major corporations to distribute grants to small businesses, with many programs specifically targeting women-owned businesses. Past partners have included Verizon, Progressive, and FedEx. New grant rounds open throughout the year.

**Visa She's Next Grant Program:** Visa's grant program supports women-owned small businesses with funding, coaching, and access to Visa's business resources. The program runs in waves, so check for open application periods.

**Tory Burch Foundation Fellows Program:** Offers women entrepreneurs education, mentorship, and access to capital through a fellowship program. Selected fellows receive business education through a partnership with Goldman Sachs and become part of a powerful network of women entrepreneurs.

## State and Local Grants

Beyond national programs, many states, cities, and regional economic development organizations offer grants specifically for women-owned businesses.

**State Programs:** States like California, New York, Texas, and Florida have economic development agencies that periodically offer grants to women entrepreneurs, often focused on specific industries or underserved communities. Some states also offer tax incentives and procurement preferences for certified women-owned businesses.

**City and County Programs:** Local governments frequently launch grant programs to support small businesses, with many specifically targeting women-owned and minority-owned businesses. These programs often have less competition than national grants because they're limited to businesses in a specific area.

**Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs):** These mission-driven lenders often provide microloans and sometimes grants to women entrepreneurs, particularly in underserved communities.

**Regional Foundations:** Many community foundations and regional nonprofits offer small business grants to local entrepreneurs. These can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands.

The best way to find state and local grants is to check your city's business resources. Browse the [SparkLocal resource directory](/resources) to find programs in your area — we cover 2,400+ resources across 309 cities, including grants, accelerators, and small business support organizations.

## How to Write a Strong Grant Application

Finding grants is only half the battle. You also need to submit applications that stand out. Here's how to improve your chances:

**Follow Instructions Exactly:** This sounds obvious, but it's the number one reason applications get rejected. If the application asks for a one-page summary, don't submit two pages. If they want a specific file format, use that format. Grant reviewers often have hundreds of applications to evaluate — don't give them an easy reason to disqualify yours.

**Tell Your Story Authentically:** Grant programs want to fund real people with compelling visions. Share why you started your business, the problem you're solving, and what drives you. Be genuine. Reviewers can tell the difference between authentic passion and generic corporate-speak.

**Present a Clear Budget:** Show exactly how you'll use the grant funds. Be specific: "We'll use $5,000 for inventory and $2,500 for marketing" is better than "We'll use funds for business growth." A detailed budget demonstrates that you've thought through your needs and will use the money responsibly.

**Quantify Your Impact:** Whenever possible, use numbers. How many customers will you serve? How many jobs will you create? What revenue growth do you project? Measurable outcomes help reviewers understand the real-world impact of their investment.

**Apply to Many Programs:** Rejection is part of the process. Even strong applications get turned down due to limited funding or stiff competition. Cast a wide net — apply to every grant you qualify for. Your odds increase with every application you submit.

**Get Feedback Before Submitting:** If possible, have someone else review your application. Fresh eyes catch errors and confusing language. Many Women's Business Centers offer free application review services.
