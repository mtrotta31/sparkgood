Here's something most new entrepreneurs don't know: there's a massive network of free business support available in nearly every city in America.

We're not talking about expensive consultants or courses. We're talking about taxpayer-funded programs, volunteer mentors, and nonprofit organizations that exist specifically to help people like you start and grow a business. These programs offer one-on-one mentoring, free business plan reviews, market research assistance, and expert advice — all at no cost.

The problem? Nobody talks about them. They don't have big marketing budgets. They're not on TikTok. So most people start their business journey feeling completely alone, not realizing that experienced help is waiting just a few clicks or phone calls away.

Let's change that. Here's your guide to finding free business help in your city.

## SCORE — Free Mentorship from Experienced Entrepreneurs

SCORE is one of the best-kept secrets in American business. It's a nonprofit organization of more than 10,000 volunteer mentors — many of them retired business owners, executives, and industry experts — who offer free mentoring to aspiring entrepreneurs.

That's right: free. You can sit down with someone who spent 30 years running a manufacturing company, or built a successful restaurant, or scaled a tech startup, and pick their brain about your business idea. They'll help you refine your concept, review your business plan, troubleshoot problems, and share lessons from their own experience.

SCORE has more than 250 local chapters across the country. Mentoring happens in person, over the phone, or by video call — whatever works for you. Many chapters also host free workshops on topics like marketing, financial planning, and legal basics.

**How to get started:** Visit score.org and request a mentor. You'll fill out a brief form about your business and goals, and SCORE will match you with a mentor whose experience fits your needs. There's no catch, no upsell — just genuine help from people who want to see you succeed.

You can also find SCORE chapters and other SBA-funded programs through the [SBA resources directory](/resources/sba).

## Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)

If SCORE provides mentorship, Small Business Development Centers provide consulting. SBDCs are funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration and hosted by universities, colleges, and state economic development agencies across the country.

There are nearly 1,000 SBDC locations nationwide, which means there's almost certainly one within driving distance of wherever you are.

SBDCs offer free one-on-one consulting with trained business advisors. Unlike SCORE's volunteer mentors, SBDC advisors are typically paid professionals with expertise in areas like:

- Business plan development
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Financial projections and cash flow planning
- Loan packaging and funding applications
- Marketing strategy
- Government contracting

Here's the thing most people don't realize: SBDC advisors will actually do work for you. They'll help you research your market, review your financials, and prepare loan applications. It's like having a free business consultant on your team.

Many SBDC locations also host workshops and training programs throughout the year. Some have specialized programs for specific industries or business types.

**How to get started:** Search "SBDC" plus your city or state to find your local center, or browse the [SBA resources in your city](/resources/sba). Most centers let you request an appointment online.

## Women's Business Centers (WBCs)

Women's Business Centers are another SBA-funded program, designed specifically to support women entrepreneurs. There are over 140 WBCs across the United States, offering training, counseling, and access to resources tailored to the unique challenges women face in business.

WBCs provide:

- Business training programs (often multi-week courses covering fundamentals)
- One-on-one counseling and mentorship
- Networking events and peer support groups
- Help accessing loans and capital
- Connections to women-focused grant programs

You don't need to be starting a "women-focused" business to use a WBC. If you're a woman starting any kind of business — a tech company, a restaurant, a consulting firm, anything — WBCs are there to help.

Many WBCs also serve their broader communities and welcome all entrepreneurs, not just women. It's worth checking what your local center offers.

**How to get started:** Find Women's Business Centers through the [SBA resources directory](/resources/sba) or search "Women's Business Center" plus your city.

## Local Libraries and Community Colleges

Here's an underrated resource: your local library.

Many public libraries have expanded their services to support entrepreneurs and small business owners. Depending on your library system, you might have access to:

- Free business databases (market research, company information, industry reports)
- Business plan workshops and startup classes
- One-on-one sessions with a business librarian
- Meeting rooms for client calls or team work
- Even "library of things" programs that let you borrow equipment

Some larger library systems have dedicated business centers or entrepreneur-in-residence programs. The New York Public Library, for example, has an entire business center with advisors on staff.

Community colleges are similarly valuable. Many offer low-cost or free continuing education courses in business fundamentals, accounting, marketing, and specific skills. Some have small business incubators or partnerships with local SBDCs.

**How to get started:** Visit your local library's website or stop by in person. Ask if they have business resources or programs for entrepreneurs. You might be surprised what's available.

## Coworking Spaces with Community Programs

Coworking spaces aren't free (the memberships, at least), but many offer free events, workshops, and community programs that anyone can attend.

Look for:

- Startup weekends and hackathons
- Pitch nights where founders practice presenting
- Networking events and industry meetups
- Lunch-and-learn sessions with local experts
- Office hours with mentors or investors

These events are a great way to meet other entrepreneurs, learn from more experienced founders, and get plugged into your local startup community — even if you're not ready to pay for a coworking membership.

Some coworking spaces also offer free or discounted memberships for early-stage founders, nonprofit leaders, or specific programs. It doesn't hurt to ask.

Browse [coworking spaces in your city](/resources/coworking) to see what's available near you. Check their events calendars for free programming.

## How to Find All These Resources in One Place

Here's the challenge: all of these resources exist, but they're scattered across different websites, directories, and local organizations. Finding what's available in your specific city takes real digging.

That's exactly why we built SparkLocal.

Our [resource directory](/resources) brings together over 2,400 resources for entrepreneurs across 309 cities. We've mapped out SCORE chapters, SBDCs, Women's Business Centers, coworking spaces, accelerators, grants, and more — organized by location and category so you can find exactly what you need.

Search for your city and see what's available. Filter by the type of help you're looking for. Save resources you want to explore later.

Whether you're in a major city like [Los Angeles](/resources/los-angeles-ca), [Houston](/resources/houston-tx), or [Phoenix](/resources/phoenix-az), or a smaller community, there are likely resources waiting for you that you haven't discovered yet.

And if you're still figuring out what business to start — or you want to build out a proper plan before meeting with mentors — try our [free business builder](/builder). It'll help you develop your idea with market research, financial projections, and a step-by-step launch checklist. Walking into a SCORE meeting with a solid plan will make that mentorship even more valuable.

## You Don't Have to Figure This Out Alone

Starting a business can feel isolating. It's easy to think you need to have all the answers, that asking for help is a sign of weakness, or that resources like these are only for "other people."

They're not. They're for you.

Thousands of SCORE mentors volunteer their time because they genuinely want to help the next generation of entrepreneurs succeed. SBDC advisors chose this work because they believe in small business. Librarians, community college instructors, and coworking community managers show up every day to support people exactly like you.

The help is there. The mentorship is there. The free resources are there. You just need to take the first step.

Find a mentor. Book a consultation. Attend a workshop. Ask for help.

Your business will be better for it.
